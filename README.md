# üîÑ Corrective RAG Agent

A sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that implements a corrective multi-stage workflow using LangGraph. This advanced system combines document retrieval, relevance grading, query transformation, and web search to provide comprehensive and accurate responses through intelligent self-correction mechanisms.

## üåü Features

### Core Functionality
- **Smart Document Retrieval**: Uses Qdrant vector store for efficient document retrieval
- **Document Relevance Grading**: Employs Claude 3.5 sonnet to assess document relevance
- **Query Transformation**: Improves search results by optimizing queries when needed
- **Web Search Fallback**: Uses Tavily API for web search when local documents aren't sufficient
- **Multi-Model Approach**: Combines OpenAI embeddings and Claude 3.5 sonnet for different tasks
- **Interactive UI**: Built with Streamlit for easy document upload and querying

### Advanced Capabilities
- **Self-Correction**: Automatically identifies and corrects retrieval issues
- **Relevance Assessment**: Intelligent scoring of document relevance
- **Query Optimization**: Dynamic query refinement for better results
- **Multi-Source Integration**: Seamlessly combines local and web sources
- **Workflow Visualization**: Step-by-step process visualization
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in quality checks and validation
